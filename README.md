Day planner shows a "to do" list for the current day from 8:00 to 17:00. When you enter a "to do" it & hit the save button it will save that "to do". When the screen first comes up in will pull in all the "to do's" that were entered before & put them in their correct hour(Note: It will only hold one "to do" per hour. Also when the screen comes up past hours will be shaded gray, the current hour will be shaded red & future hours will be shaded green.
